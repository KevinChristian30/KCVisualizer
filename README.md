# KCVisualizer
> An algorithms visualizer to help students visualize searching and sorting algorithms.

This console application visualizes sorting algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort), and path finding algorithms (Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Dijkstra's, and A*)

## Installing / Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KevinChristian30/KCVisualizer
```

The command above will fetch the repository.

### Initial Configuration

```shell
make
```
The command above will compile the source code to an exe file

## Features
* Usage of colors in the windows API to better visualize the algorithms.
* Enabled mouse click on console using windows API for a better user experience.
* Managed memory by releasing uneeded heap memory usage.
* Quick Sort.
* Merge Sort.
* Heap Sort.
* Breadth First Search.
* Depth First Search.
* Dijkstra's Algorithm.
* A* Algorithm.
* Sandbox mode to create obstacles and select starting and ending points for the pathfinding algorithms.
